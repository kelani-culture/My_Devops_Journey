## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

In this markdown I am going to talk about my understanding of the software
development lifecycle (SDLC) and all that I understand from its

### Definition

Software development lifecycle is the time efficient and cost-effective process
that developers use to design and build high-quality software. The main goal is
to reduce project risk through forward planning so that software meet customer
expectation

This design process make it ease for developers to build and ship product to the
last customer it covers the process and step development teams need to take to
develop a well rounded product for their consumers

### HOW SDLC WORK

## Companies have different approach towards **_SDLC_** process but some of the most common are.

1. Planning: The planning phase is when the development team comes together to
   make major plans about the development of the product and resources needed to
   accomplish the task hand. They can discuss about the cost and time efficiency
   of the project this includes making budget plans, allocating task, and also
   scheduling how long each member are going to take work on a specific task.

2. Design: In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and
   Identify the best solutions to create the software. For example they may
   consider integrating pre-existing modules, make technology choices and
   identify development tools.

3. Implementation: This phase is when all member of the development teams get
   too work on the specific task assigned to them during the planning phase.
   During this phase each during this phase each section/features of the
   application will be worked upon then brought later together too make the
   application a whole

4. Test: This phase is where the development work on different test in other to
   check for bugs and fix they combine both automation and manual testing to
   quickly fix bug and the also perform some quality analysis test which include
   checking the software for bugs and security flaw that can have some damaging
   effect to the product if release to production

5. Deploy: During this phase the product have gone through testing giving the
   team enough assurance to deploy the application for the final user too use.

6. Maintain: After the deployment of the application the team still need to work
   on maintaing the app, they take in user feedback that can work well in
   improving the application they also add some new features that allow the app
   too meet user tastes. they also watch out for scalability issue. This include
   handling many multiple user requests.

### SDLC Models

A software development lifestyle cycle (SDLC) model conceptually presents SDLC
in an organized fashion to help organization implement its. Different models
arrange the SDLC phases in varying order to optimize the development

---

- Waterfall: This is a SDLC model that works implement the the SDLC phase in a
  linear way it works from top-to-bottom this means that you get to go through
  all the phase linearly from planning to maintainenance this model is more
  suitable for small scale project because of the little room for change it
  provided. which makes it less suitable for large scale project.

- Iterative: This process means that teams begin the software development with a
  small subsets requiremnts. Then,they iteratively enhance versions over time
  until the complete software is ready for production. The team produce a new
  software for each iteration.

- Agile: The agile method combines both the waterfall and iterative models. It arranges all the phases into several development life cycles. The team iterates through the phases rapidly, allwoing them to deliver only small incremental software changes in each cycle. They continously evaluates requirements plans and result so they can respond quickly to change.

and lastly we have the **Spiral** model
